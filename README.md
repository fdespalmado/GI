* 4EoO: simple simulation for the average proc rate of the 4pc Echoes of Offering artifact set.
  * 2pc effect: +18% ATK
  * 4pc effect: When a Normal Attack hits opponents, there is a 36% chance that it will trigger Valley Rite, which will increase Normal Attack Damage by 70% of ATK. This                 effect will be dispelled 0.05s after a Normal Attack deals DMG. If a Normal Attack fails to trigger a Valley Rite, the odds of it triggering the next                     time will increase by 20%. This trigger can occur every 0.2s
